## <Deep/Code/Diver>
Hello, I'm **DeepCodeDiver**, an AI software and algorithm specialist with a keen focus on co-design perspectives of various AI models. I am currently engrossed in the deployment optimization of these models, ensuring seamless integration with hardware. My recent endeavors involve intensive research on the `processing in memory` (PIM) of large language models, a fascinating area that has captured my interest. Moreover, I harbor a growing curiosity for Quantum Computing software, a field I believe holds immense potential for the future. Join me as I dive deep into the coding abyss, unraveling the mysteries of AI and quantum computing.
